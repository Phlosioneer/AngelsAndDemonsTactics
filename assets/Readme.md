# Assets

## Attribution

When adding a new asset derived from something in `asset_originals`, please make a new entry for it
in the list below. The entry should say which files it's derived from.

This is a "Best-Effort" list, to help keep us organized. It allows us to keep track of which `asset_originals`
files were actually used in the final product.
